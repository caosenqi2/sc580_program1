### Guidelines

This is an individual assignment. You must do the vast majority of the work on your own. It is permissible to consult with classmates to ask general questions about the assignment, to help discover and fix specific bugs, and to talk about high level approaches in general terms. It is not permissible to give or receive answers or solution details from fellow students.

You may research online for additional resources; however, you may not use code that was written specifically *to* solve the problem you have been given, and you may not have anyone else help you write the code or solve the problem. You may use code snippets found online, providing that they are appropriately and clearly cited, within your submitted code.

*By submitting this assignment, you agree that you have followed the above guidelines regarding collaboration and research.*

__In this program, you will learn to__:

* Write basic C code
* Work with binary values

## Part A: Writing the Code

The included driver code has several functions that you must complete. Each function is described below. You __MUST__ not change the driver code (the main());

#### int findNextMultiple(int number1, int number2)
To round off an integer i to the next largest even multiple of another integer j, the following formula can be used:
* int next_multiple = i + j - i % j
    * For example, to round off 256 days to the next largest number of days evenly divisible by a week, values of i = 256 and j = 7 can be substituted into the preceding formula as follows:
    int next_multiple = 256 + 7 - 256 % 7

* Complete the function called `findNextMultiple` to find the next largest even multiple for the following values of i and j:
    *   |i|j|
        |--|--|
        |365|7|
        |12258|28|
        |996|4|

#### float convertFtoC(float fahrenheit)
Write a function, float convertFtoC(float fahrenheit), that converts 40Â° from degrees Fahrenheit (F) to degrees Celsius (C) using the following formula and returns the result:
    * C = (F - 32) / 1.8

#### int castToInt(long num), double castToDouble(long num), char castToChar(long num)
In the next part of the program we are going to see how choosing the wrong data types and careless casting can result in data loss. You should see inaccurate results. Complete the functions to typecast a long integer to the following datatypes
* int
* double
* char

### int fibonacci()
In the Fibonacci sequence, the first two Fibonacci numbers, called f0 and f1, are defined to be 0 and 1, respectively. Thereafter, each successive Fibonacci number fi is defined to be the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers fi2 and fi1. So fi2 is calculated by adding together the values of fi0 and fi1.
     * Write a function that generates the first 20 fibonacci numbers _(including 0 and 1)_ using a loop.
     * You should return the final resulting value (the 20th value)

## Part B: Working with Colors

RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display. Red, green, and blue can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. Intensity of each color is represented by the range of decimal numbers from 0 to 255 (256 levels for each color), equivalent to the range of binary numbers from 00000000 to 11111111, or hexadecimal 00 to FF.

For the second part of the assignment you will need to work with bit masking to determine the most prominent color in a given RGB value. You should return an integer corresponding to the most prominent color:

0. Unknown
1. Red
2. Green
3. Blue

You will need to separate the Red, Green, and Blue values, and determine which value is largest. Once you have determined the largest value, you must return the corresponding number for that color.

For example, the value 0xFFF000000 would return 1 for Red, and 0x000FFF000 would return 2 for Green.

If any two of the RGB colors are equal, the function should return 0.

## Part C: Submission
* Required code naming and organization:
    * program1.c

:no_entry: Every program will have a required submission guidelines. Please read submission requirements carefully. Any deviations from specifications on future programs will result in point deductions or incomplete grades.

## README

You should have notice that part of this readme file has three sections titled:
* KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS
* REFERENCES
* MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS

Before your final submission, edit the content for each of these sections in this README for your program. You do not have to use markdown, but you can find out more about markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) if you would like to.

### Git

In this and future programs, we will use Github Classroom repositories. You have already [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository when you accepted the emailed link. That makes a copy of the repository, free for you to make changes. Then you cloned your forked repository to get a working copy onto this machine.

Now that we have made local changes to our working copy, let's [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) those changes to the repository:

:warning: *These commands all presume that your current working directory is within the directory tracked by `git`.*

```shell
git commit -a -m "first commit"
```

The `-a` says that git should add all tracked files with changes to your commit, and the `-m` says the next string contains the commit message, which is required by git any time you make a commit.

What about _untracked files_? Run the following commands:

```shell
touch info.txt
git status
```
You'll notice that `git` tells us that `info.txt` is an _untracked file_. That means it's not being tracked by the repository. Let's fix that by [adding](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) it.

```shell
git add info.txt
git commit -a -m "Added info.txt file"
```
:warning: *You* __must__ *add any new files you create to the repository with the `git add` command or they will not upload to the repo, and your code will not work.*

Once we've made the commits for a given coding session, we need to add those to the repository by performing a [push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push):

```shell
git push
```

Lastly, the next time we begin a coding session, we will need to [pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) to ensure we have the most updated working copy.

```shell
git pull
```
:bulb: You should get a message that you are already up to date.

This will allow you to keep your code in the lab and on your own computer synchronized if you want to work outside of lab.

Lastly we are going to make our final commit. You will need to do this when your submission is ready for grading.

```shell
git commit -a -m "final commit message"
git push
```

:bulb: You may get a message that there have not been any changes. That's okay, that just means you have already *commited* all changes.

You can commit as often as you like, and revert your code to any previous commit using the **commit hash**. The commit hash is a long number that identifies a specific version of your code. I recommending making commits often with a comment describing the state of your code. To find your most recent commit hash, use the following command:

```shell
git rev-parse HEAD
```    
You should get a long, strange looking number:
```
35e27598324d8b4d7ddeb4d7aa8abe91c6263705
```

To complete your submission, you must copy and paste this number into mycourses. Go to MyCourses, select cs580u, and **Assignment Hash Submission**. Select Program 0, and where it says text submission, paste your commit hash. The TAs will only grade your submission that corresponds to the hash you submitted. You can update this as often as you like until the deadline.

I strongly recommend making a submission early on, even if your assignment is not 100% working, to avoid late penalties. You can resubmit as many times as you like.

:warning: You __MUST__ submit the commit hash on mycourses before the deadline to be considered on time **even if your program is completely working before the deadline**. :warning:

That's it! We've completed our work for this program. We will use this submission process for all subsequent programs.
